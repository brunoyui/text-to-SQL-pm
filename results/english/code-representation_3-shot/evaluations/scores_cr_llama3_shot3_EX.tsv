127_1	SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' shows that permit-related activities are present in the event log. 2. SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Declaration%' (not provided, but implied) would show that declaration-related activities are also present in the event log. To combine these, we can use the OR operator: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' OR activity LIKE '%Declaration%'	SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%permit%' OR activity LIKE '%declaration%'	extra	0
127_2	SELECT Based on the provided SQL examples and database schema, I'll answer the questions: 1. Actions related to permits were performed during the processing of which declarations? The query select idcase from event_log where activity like 'Permit%' GROUP BY idcase HAVING count(*) > 1 suggests that the idcase 1s that have more than one permit-related activity (i.e., activity column contains a string that starts with 'Permit') are the ones that were processed during the permit-related actions. 2. What characterizes the interventions that generate a permit during the processing of a declaration? The query SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' returns all rows from the event_log table where the activity column contains a string that includes the word 'Permit'. This suggests that the interventions that generate a permit during the processing of a declaration are those that have an activity 1 that includes the word 'Permit'. 3. The performances of the 'permit' activity are associated with which events? How are these events characterized? The query SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' returns all rows from the event_log table where the activity column contains a string that includes the word 'Permit'. This suggests that the events associated with the 'permit' activity are those that have an activity 1 that includes the word 'Permit'. 4. Which of the activities involve 'permit' or 'declaration' actions? The query SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' OR activity LIKE '%Declaration%' returns all rows from the event_log table where the activity column contains a string that includes the word 'Permit' or 'Declaration'. This suggests that the activities that involve 'permit' or 'declaration' actions are those that have an activity 1 that includes either the word 'Permit' or 'Declaration'.
