Answer: SELECT events_count, COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as events_count, idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) GROUP BY events_count 3. Calculate the number of events per case and report how many cases correspond to each number. Answer: SELECT events_count, COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as events_count, idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) GROUP BY events_count 4. List the case identifiers that have more than three events. Answer: select idcase from event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 3 5. List the case identifiers that have more than 3 events. Answer: select idcase from event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 3 6. List the number of events associated with each case.

184_8	Based on the provided SQL examples and database schema, I'll answer the questions: 1. What are the actions related to permits and explicit declarations in the declaration management process? The SQL query SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%permit%' OR activity LIKE '%declaration%' returns the distinct activities related to permits and declarations. 2. Which of the activities involve 'permit' or 'declaration' actions? The same SQL query as above returns the activities that involve 'permit' or 'declaration' actions. 3. What activities involve 'permit' or 'declaration'? Again, the same SQL query returns the activities that involve 'permit' or 'declaration'. 4. What activities involve a permit or declaration? The same SQL query returns the activities that involve a permit or declaration. 5. What information is associated with permit interventions, within the processing of a declaration? The SQL query SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' returns all the information (id, activity, timestamp, resource, cost, idcase) associated with permit interventions during the processing of a declaration. 6. Actions related to permits were performed during the processing of which declarations? To answer this question, we would need to join the event_log table with another table that contains information about declarations. However, based on the provided schema, we don't have such a table. We would need additional information to answer this question.	select idcase from event_log where activity like 'Permit%' GROUP BY idcase HAVING count(*) > 1	hard	0
