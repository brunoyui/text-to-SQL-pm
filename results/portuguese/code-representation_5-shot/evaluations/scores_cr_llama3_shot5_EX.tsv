63_7	"SELECT Based on the provided SQL examples and the given database schema, I'll try to answer the last question: ""O que caracteriza os eventos associados à execução da atividade 'permissão'?"" The answer is not a simple SQL query, but rather a description of the characteristics of the events associated with the execution of the 'permissão' activity. From the SQL examples, we can infer that the events associated with the 'permissão' activity have the following characteristics: * They have an activity name that starts with the string 'permissão' (e.g., 'permissão_x', 'permissão_y', etc.). * They are associated with a specific case, identified by the 'idcase' column. * They have a timestamp, which represents the time when the event occurred. * They may have a resource associated with them, identified by the'resource' column. * They may have a cost associated with them, identified by the 'cost' column. In summary, the events associated with the 'permissão' activity are characterized by their activity name, case ID, timestamp, resource, and cost."

In the query SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, idcase HAVING count(activity) > 3, an action had to be executed more than three times for each idcase that has more than three occurrences of that activity. The other queries do not require an action to be executed more than once. As for the last query, it is incomplete and does not provide enough information to answer the question. However, based on the schema provided, it seems that the query is trying to find which activities Virginia has no experience with.
