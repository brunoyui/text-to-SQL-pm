From the SQL examples, we can infer that the events associated with the execution of the activity 'permissão' have the following characteristics: 1. The activity name starts with the string 'permissão'. 2. There may be multiple events associated with the same activity 'permissão' (as seen in the second SQL example). 3. The first event associated with the activity 'permissão' has a specific timestamp (as seen in the third SQL example). In summary, the events associated with the execution of the activity 'permissão' are characterized by having an activity name that starts with the string 'permissão', and possibly having multiple events with the same activity name."

124_7	SELECT Based on the provided SQL examples, the most common actions in processing declarations are: 1. **Filtering**: Filtering data to extract specific information, such as listing actions that start with the letter 'E' (Example 2). 2. **Grouping and Aggregation**: Grouping data by specific columns and performing aggregation operations, such as counting the frequency of each activity (Example 1). 3. **Window Functions**: Using window functions to analyze data within a group, such as identifying consecutive actions performed by different resources (Example 3). 4. **Pattern Matching**: Using pattern matching to search for specific patterns in data, such as finding actions that contain the word 'declaração' (Example 4). These actions are common in processing declarations because they allow you to: * Filter out irrelevant data * Identify patterns and trends * Analyze data at different levels of granularity * Extract specific information from large datasets In the context of the provided schema, these actions can be used to analyze the event log data, such as identifying the most common activities, finding consecutive actions performed by different resources, or extracting specific information about declarations.
